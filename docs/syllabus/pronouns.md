New this year: you may **[submit a recording of your name](https://it.wustl.edu/items/namecoach-in-canvas/)** or **[designate your pronouns](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-select-personal-pronouns-in-my-user-account-as-a/ta-p/456)** on Canvas. I will be reviewing these submissions, but please remind/correct me if I get anything wrong.

Washington University in St. Louis recognizes that many students prefer to use names other than their legal ones to identify themselves. In addition, in order to affirm each person’s gender identity and lived experiences, it is important that we ask and check in with others about pronouns. This simple effort can make a profound difference in a person’s experience of safety, respect, and support.
