## Grading Breakdown

### Homeworks - 50%
- 7 homeworks planned (making them worth about 7 points each)
- Most, if not all, homeworks will be autograded.
- The autograder will accept unlimited submissions up to the deadline.

### Project - 50%
- Each group will be expected to curate a data set and establish analysis techniques in the form of a [Kaggle Community Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/community-competitions-setup-guide). Actual submission to the Kaggle platform is advised but not required. Requirements for the project may build upon those provided by Kaggle to tailor the content for this course.
- DCDS students may form their own group or choose to join one, but are allowed and encouraged to opt for an individual project tailored towards personal research, as opposed to the Kaggle competition format. Scope of allowed projects may include a data dashboard, a data processing technique, or an aggregated data set from multiple sources.
- **20% - Progress reports**
    - Each group will be expected to submit a progress report. Guidelines for the content of the report will be provided, but these are expected to be brief check-ins (1 or 2 pages) that will allow me to help you make sure your project is in scope, that work is being distributed and executed equitably among the group, and provide feedback on the direction of the project.
- **30% - Final project**
    - A rubric will be provided early in the semester for grading criteria on the project, but will generally encompass things like documentation, data cleanliness, code cleanliness, and creativity. Each group will be expected to give a brief presentation towards the end of the semester providing the context for their work.
