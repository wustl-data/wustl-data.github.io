## Course Policy

Coding assignments must represent your own work. You may discuss high-level approaches to problems with your classmates, but you must acknowledge your collaborators (including Piazza discussions) in the README of your submitted assignment. Do not otherwise copy, borrow, or share coding implementations of your work. Assignments will be run through an automated similarity checker and flagged if suspicious.

## University Policy

Effective learning, teaching and research all depend upon the ability of members of the academic community to trust one another and to trust the integrity of work that is submitted for academic credit or conducted in the wider arena of scholarly research. Such an atmosphere of mutual trust fosters the free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential.

In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged and work that is presented as original must be, in fact, original. Faculty, students and administrative staff all share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at Washington University in St. Louis.

## McKelvey Engineering Academic Integrity Policy

This statement on student academic integrity is intended to provide guidelines on academic behaviors which are not acceptable. Engineering courses typically have many problem sets assigned as homework. You are not allowed to collaborate when solving homework problems, performing lab experiments, writing or documenting computer programs, or writing reports unless the instructor specifically states otherwise.

It is dishonest and a violation of academic integrity if:

- You turn in work which is represented as yours when in fact you have significant outside help. When you turn in work with your name on it, you are in effect stating that the work is yours, and only yours.
- You use the results of another person's work (exam, homework, computer code, lab report) and represent it as your own, regardless of the circumstances.
- You request special consideration from an instructor when the request is based upon false information or deception.
- You submit the same academic work to two or more courses without the permission of each of the course instructors. This includes submitting the same work if the same course is retaken.
- You willfully damage the efforts of other students.
- You use prepared materials in writing an in-class exam except as approved by the instructor.
- You write on or make erasures on any test material or class assignment being submitted for re-grading.
- You collaborate with other students planning or engaged in any form of academic dishonesty.
- You turn in work, which is represented as a cooperative effort, when in fact you did not contribute your fair share of the effort.
- You do not use proper methods of documentation. For example, you should enclose borrowed information in quotation marks; acknowledge material that you have abstracted, paraphrased or summarized; cite the source of such material by listing the author, title of work, publication, and page reference.
