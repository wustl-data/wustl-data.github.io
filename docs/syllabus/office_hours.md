Office Hours will generally be held on **Fridays at noon**. If you need to meet with me outside of office hours, please email me to schedule a time, however, you are encouraged to seek general homework help on Piazza.

Office hours will be held in Zoom or in person depending on my availability, but for in-person office hours I will also keep a Zoom call open for folks to call in virtually if they wish. Stay tuned to announcements on Canvas and/or Piazza for in-person locations, and check the Zoom schedule on Canvas for the Zoom link.
