## Disability Resources

WashU supports the right of all enrolled students to an equitable educational opportunity, and strives to create an inclusive learning environment. In the event the physical or online environment results in barriers to the inclusion of a student due to a disability, they should notify the instructor as soon as possible.

Disabled students requiring adjustments to equitably complete expectations in this course should contact WashU’s Disability Resources (DR), and engage in a process for determining and communicating reasonable accommodations. Because accommodations are not applied retroactively, DR recommends initiating requests prior to, or at the beginning of, the academic term to avoid delays in accessing accommodations once classes begin. Once established, responsibility for disability-related accommodations and access is shared by Disability Resources, faculty, and the student.

## Religious Observance

As home to students, faculty, and staff of all the world’s major religions and as a non-sectarian
institution, Washington University in St. Louis values the rich diversity of spiritual expression
and practice found on campus. It is therefore the policy of the university that students who
miss class, assignments, or exams to observe a religious holiday should be accommodated as
follows:
(i) absences should be counted as excused in any course in which attendance is a
measure of academic performance;
(ii) reasonable extensions of time should be given, without academic penalty, for
missed assignments;
(iii) exams should be reasonably rescheduled without academic penalty.
To ensure that accommodations may be made, students who plan to miss class for a religious
holiday must inform their instructors in writing before the end of the third week of class, or as
soon as possible if the holiday occurs during the first three weeks of the semester.
Absence for religious reasons does not lessen students’ responsibility for course work or
material covered during their absence. It is incumbent on the student who misses a class to
catch up on any material discussed and assignments given during that class period. If you
believe you have not received a reasonable accommodation despite engaging with your
instructor on the topic, please follow the course grievance process outlined by your school.
