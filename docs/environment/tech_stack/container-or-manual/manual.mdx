:::tip NEW - ONE CLICK SETUP

Students interested in an experimental approach to environment setup may skip to the [Dev Container](#dev_container) section at the bottom of this page. However, I encourage everyone to follow this *manual setup* at least once, to *a)* gain familiarity with the various tools and technologies used in this course and *b)* sharpen your debugging skills.

:::

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own development environment. It aims to cover common approaches and make suggestions. I encourage everyone to perform the motions at least once. However, you are encouraged to use the *Dev Container* and all of its glorious convenience.

Follow these steps to get a working Python environment up and running that should prepare you for the programming assignments in this course. These are suggestions to get you started -- you may use your own environment setups if you are more familiar with them (i.e. Anaconda distribution, pure-Windows setups, etc.). If you are confident using your own environment, you may skip to [Clone This Repository](#clone-this-repository) to test out our workflow. 

If following this tutorial causes errors at any step of the process, please [post a question to Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/l740jfqb11u6vy) -- it is likely other students are experiencing the same problem as well. Obviously, you may skip any steps for which you already have the software installed.

    <h3>Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL] - <i>recommended</i></h3>
    <p>Windows users are highly encouraged to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for code development. WSL provides a fully-operational Ubuntu operating system that runs on a virtual machine within Windows. Ubuntu provides a Unix-style command-line interface (`bash` by default) which matches the interface commonly found in various software tutorials and installation instructions.</p>

## Python

This course will involve intermediate Python techniques. While no one is expected to know Python coming into this course, if you are new to Python, you may want to check out the Resources page and be sure to perform the pre-class exercises.

:::caution What about `my favorite programming language`?

Some of you may have previous experience performing data manipulation in **R**, **MATLAB**, or similar. If you feel that you are able to efficiently perform the assignments in a different programming language, you are free to do so with the following caveats:
  - You understand that documentation and homework support may not be available for debugging syntax errors, etc.
  - For autograded assignments, you are responsible for making your code play nicely with the Python autograder. That may include rewriting your solution, using 3rd party Python connector packages, and/or writing your own function hooks.
  - You must include all code in your assignment submissions.
