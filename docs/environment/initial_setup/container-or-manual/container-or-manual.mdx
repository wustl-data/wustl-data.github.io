## Dev Containers & Preconfigured Environments
Exciting developments in Docker containerization standards have brought [*Dev Containers*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to the VS Code IDE. This is a new feature that allows for easy distribution of isolated and preconfigured development environment, fully equipped for VS Code with a single click. While new technologies can come with a bit of a learning curve, this setup *should* provide a more convenient way to [standardize environment setup](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/iticse22.pdf) across students in the class with many different laptop models and programming backgrounds.

You are encouraged to use the **Dev Container** configuration if you are at least somewhat familiar with the tech stack and you want to get right down to the data wrangling with a working setup. However, if you run into blockers, prefer to set up your own environment, or need more background on our tooling, you should try out the [manual setup](manual-setup). If you're still not sure what to do, you may consult the comparison table and the descriptions below to choose an approach that fits your case. Keep in mind you may always shift your approach later on as you grow more comfortable with the tools.

Select the tab that matches the OS on your host machine (i.e., your laptop) and examine the various restrictions and capabilities of the different approaches.
