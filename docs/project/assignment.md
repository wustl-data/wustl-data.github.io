## Project Goals

The primary goal of this assignment is for your team to construct an interesting problem statement and a data set that can be used to solve that problem statement. You will then use the data set to construct a data pipeline that can be used to analyze the data. You should use your data pipeline to provide a `benchmark` analysis of your problem statement.

## Scope of project

These specifications above are left intentionally vague so that teams have the freedom to explore a topic domain of their choosing; knowledge of a problem domain and motivation to study it will be one of your most helpful tools. The only hard requirements of the project are thus:

1. The construction of your data set and your data pipeline must cover, on average, 3 of our 8 course modules. On average, the amount of work needed to cover each module topic should be the expected contribution from one individual team member. The actual distribution of the work is up to you. These requirements will be formalized via a spreadsheet in one of your progress reports, but are flexible and fluid through the course of the project. Here are some examples of how you might scope your project.

    - Your project covers the modules "Normalization", "Cleaning", and "Dashboards". However, you realize that your data sources are already mostly normalized and the thus might only make up 1/2 the contribution from one of your team members. You may decide to add "Data Visualization" to your project to make up the difference.
    - Your project covers the modules "APIs", "SQL", and "Dashboards". Instead of assigning one module topic per person, you decide that 1 of you will work on building your API client and the other 2 will split the work on SQL and Dashboards. 

These are just examples, and feedback will be provided on your progress reports to help you adjust your scope as needed.

## Sample rubric

Here is a sample rubric, slightly modified from last semester to evaluate projects. You may expect a similar rubric to be used this semester.

## Kaggle competition format
Is is suggested, but not required, that you use the Kaggle Community Competition guidelines to structure your project. The requirements to submit a Community Competition are good measures you may take to share your data wrangling work with anyone.

These requirements can be found in Kaggle's documentation [here](https://www.kaggle.com/community-competitions-setup-guide). It prompts you to follow these steps in building your project:
- Create a competition
- Choose a dataset
- Prepare the dataset
- Set up scoring
- Test your competition & optionally set up a benchmark

:::tip

Projects that follow this format will be eligible for extra credit at the end of the semester--one project will be chosen for 10 points extra credit and the highest competition submission for that project will receive another 10 points extra credit on their project grade.
