## Which approach is right for you?

Exciting developments in Docker containerization standards have brought [*Dev Containers*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to the VS Code IDE. This is a new feature that allows for easy distribution of isolated and preconfigured development environment, fully equipped for VS Code with a single click. While new technologies can come with a bit of a learning curve, this setup *should* provide a more convenient way to [standardize environment setup](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/iticse22.pdf) across students in the class with many different laptop models and programming backgrounds.

:::tip GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a *cloud-hosted* version of VS Code that implements Dev Containers on GitHub and comes with the GitHub Classroom setup. If you would prefer to work locally, simply build and run the Dev Container using the instructions in the repository when you clone it from GitHub Classroom.

:::

You are encouraged to use the Dev Container configuration if you find it convenient, but it is not required. If you run into blockers or simply prefer to set up your own environment, you can do so by following the instructions in the [manual setup](./manual) section.


:::note

Regardless of your chosen setup method, you should be familiar with each of the components of our tech stack, including the unix-style Bash terminal, the Poetry package manager (similar to pipenv), and IDE features. If you're unsure, it might be a good idea to perform the walkthrough first, and then try to set up Dev Containers when you have a better grasp on the tooling. However, don't waste too much time if your environment proves difficult to set up--post a question on Piazza instead.

Consult the table below to choose an approach that fits your needs, but feel free to switch approaches at any point during the semester.

Select the tab that matches the OS on your host machine (i.e., your laptop) and examine the various restrictions and capabilities of the different approaches, including using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which you may learn more about in the manual setup instructions.
