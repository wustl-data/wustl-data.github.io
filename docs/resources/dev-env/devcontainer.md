What's that window on the right? GitHub Pro for free? That's a great deal, and you should take advantage of it. The more time you spend on GitHub, the more cash money you can make after graduation. Get cozy!

Go ahead and follow the link to your repository. If you're not familiar with git or GitHub, take a moment to 
go over the <a href='git-github' target='_blank'>Git and GitHub section of the docs</a>.
