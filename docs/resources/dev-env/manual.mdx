title: "Manual Environment Setup"
---


This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own local development environment as it applies to this class. It aims to cover common approaches and make suggestions to get you started -- you may use your own environment setups if you are more familiar with them (i.e. Anaconda distribution, pure-Windows setups, etc.). This should be a beneficial tutorial for those seeking to learn more about common software tools such as the command line and managing Python environments. However, those seeking a quicker and more convenient option should check out the [Dev Container](devcontainer) setup guide.


If following this tutorial causes errors at any step of the process, please [post a question to Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/l740jfqb11u6vy) -- it is likely other students are experiencing the same problem as well. Obviously, you may skip any steps for which you already have the software correctly installed.

## Operating System

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    <h3>Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL] - <i>recommended</i></h3>
    <p>Windows users are highly encouraged to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for code development. WSL provides a fully-operational Ubuntu operating system that runs on a virtual machine within Windows. Ubuntu provides a Unix-style command-line interface (`bash` by default) which matches the interface commonly found in various software tutorials and installation instructions. On a "pure-Windows" setup, the <i>Bash for Windows</i> program emulates a Unix-style syntax, but under the hood can often cause compatibility issues with advanced packages that take advantage of low-level operations for speed, such as machine learning packages.</p>
    
    Follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL installation instructions</a> to install WSL. Otherwise, proceed to the next steps.

    Macs generally come pretty well-configured for development, including their Unix-based terminal, preinstallation of (at least some version of) Python, among other things. You should be safe to proceed to the next steps.

## Python

This course will involve intermediate Python techniques. While no one is expected to know Python coming into this course, if you are new to Python, you may want to check out the Resources page and be sure to perform the pre-class exercises.

:::caution What about `my favorite programming language`?

Some of you may have previous experience performing data manipulation in R, MATLAB, or similar. If you feel that you are able to efficiently perform the assignments in a different programming language, you are free to do so with the following caveats:
  - You understand that documentation and homework support may not be available for debugging syntax errors, etc.
  - For autograded assignments, you are responsible for making your code play nicely with the Python autograder. That may include rewriting your solution, using 3rd party Python connector packages, and/or writing your own function hooks.
  - You must include all code in your assignment submissions.

:::

### Installation

As of this writing, the latest stable release version of Python is `3.10.6`, which will be the primary supported version for this course (other versions may work, but no promises. I wouldn't go earlier than 3.9). Check your Python version with the command `python --version`. You can manage Python versions on your machine in the following ways, among others:

#### Pyenv
A command-line Python version manager. [Installation instructions here.](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

#### OS-specific single-version install
See downloads at [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Poetry

[Link to installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Poetry is a modern Python package and dependency manager. If you are familiar with using `pip` to install Python package dependencies, Poetry does the same thing but also manages the files that convey these requirements to the Python interpreter: specifically, `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`. If you are used to using `pip`, this replaces the `requirements.txt` file. 

:::info What's a package?

A package is a collection of Python modules (usually a third-party library) that can be imported and used together. Pandas and Numpy are examples of Python packages. Most often, you will download a package from the Python Package Index, PyPI, using `pip` or `poetry`. We will be using Poetry.

:::


There are a few things you should keep in mind when using Poetry as opposed to a traditional `pip` setup:
- Instead of using a command like `source venv/bin/activate` to activate your Python virtual environments, use `poetry shell`.
- Instead of a `requirements.txt` file, Poetry uses a `pyproject.toml` file. This is where your dependencies are listed in a human-readable way. It is strongly advised to avoid editing this file manually, instead managing your dependencies via commands as follows.
- When you see `pip install` in installation instructions for a package, you should **use the `poetry add` command instead**. If you want to remove the package later, run `poetry remove`. More Poetry commands can be found in their [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).
- Packages are listed in `pyproject.toml` such that the specified version can be more generic. For example, if you are ok with any version of `pandas` greater than or equal to version 1.0, you can use `poetry add <package> >=1.0`. When you manage your dependencies with Poetry commands, Poetry generates a machine-readable `poetry.lock` file that contains the exact versions of all dependencies based on all of their requirements. Don't touch this file.

:::warning

If you forget and use `pip install` instead of `poetry add` to install a dependency, it will still install the package in your virtual environment. However, submitting your assignment to the autograder will fail, because the autograder reads your dependencies from `pyproject.toml`. Using `pip install` does not add the package to `pyproject.toml`.

:::

:::info What's a virtual environment?

A virtual environment is a Python environment that is isolated from the system environment. It is a folder that contains a copy of the system Python installation, with its own set of modules and packages. This is helpful for maintaning multiple projects on your machine without different package versioning needs interfering with each other.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment, i.e. Code Editor)

### Visual Studio Code - (*recommended*)

Download the latest version at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

You are strongly advised to use the [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-extensions) to enable Python support if it is not already enabled on your system. You should also configure the [black](https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0) formatter for Python -- more on this later.

### Other IDEs

:::tip

VS Code is the only IDE that has built-in integration with Dev Containers, but you may run the Dev Container manually via Docker Compose and run commands with `docker exec`, etc. if you are comfortable doing so.

:::

Perhaps the second-most-popular IDE for Python development is [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Feel free to try it out if you want a more Python-tailored IDE, or just hate Bill Gates. 

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a highly configurable code edtior popular among very techy types. I have no experience with it, but it has many fans. Check it out if you're feeling brave.


## Managing your git credentials

Making sure that your git credentials are properly stored so that you can `push` and `pull` to GitHub may be tricky if you have not set them up previously or if you're implementing a new environment. Try pushing and pulling to to your private GitHub account to test your credentials. If they are not working, try the cross-platform [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager) (note: WSL users should follow the corresponding instructions under the "Windows" section, not the "Linux/Ubuntu" section). If that proves too challenging, try setting up [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) instead. If you're still having trouble, post to Piazza.
