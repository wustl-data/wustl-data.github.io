This page of supplemental resources is made available for those who are interested in deeper information about a topic. These resources may be helpful for different students in different ways based on background and learning style, but are more in-depth than what is necessary to succeed in the class. In other words, whether you're confused about a topic or eager to learn more, these resources may point you in the right direction. I will add to this list as each module is released.
