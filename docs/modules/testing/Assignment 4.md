### [[GitHub Classroom - Assignment 4](https://classroom.github.com/a/3RHutrBD)]

*You should assume this assignment will be manually graded by default. Autograder code may be distributed and modified over the course of the week*.

Open the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset in this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/razamh/stack-overflow-developer-survey-analysis). Skim the notebook to get oriented with the data set. Determine which column contains relevant salary data for analysis and replace the dummy column names in the starter code.

:::tip

You might be thinking about downloading the .csv of the dataset into your project repo for data exploration at this step. You are more than welcome to do so, but you'll likely get more out of this assignment without it.

### IMPORTANT:

I will be looking at your git histories to track your methodology as your repo progresses. You do not have to do the steps in order, but you do need to follow the red-green-refactor methodology. **Include commits at each red-green-refactor step.**

ðŸ”´ - Write a test for a new behavior of your code

ðŸŸ¢ - Write the bare mimimum amount of code to make your test pass

âœ…âœ…âœ… - Refactor as many times as necessary, in small chunks, keeping your tests green. Commit after each refactoring.

As a courtesy, try to only perform commits at each step. Use the "staging" tree (using `git add`) to manage your files and changes as much as possible between these commits. If you end up with a lot of stray commits, look up how to do a `rebase` or `squash` with your commits. I may ask you to resubmit the assignment if your git history is hard to track.

1. **10 points** - Refactor `test_median_by_undergrad_no_data` and `test_median_by_undergrad_single_major` into a single test using the following process:
    1. Configure the tests to use the `survey` fixture in `conftest.py`.
    2. Configure the `survey` fixture to take a `salaries_majors` fixture as input.
    3. Implement the `salaries_majors` fixture to return a 2-element tuple in the format `(salaries, majors)` where `salaries` and `majors` are lists.
    4. Use the [params](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html#parametrizing-fixtures) argument to pass both test cases to the fixtures.


2. **10 points** - Using `groupby.quantile`, write tests for a function `salary_quantile` that returns the 10th, 50th, and 90th salary percentile grouped by undergraduate major.
3. **10 points** - Implement `salary_quantile`.
4. **10 points** - Refactor your `median_by_undergrad` function to use the `salary_quantile` function above.

5. **10 points** - Write tests for a function `ecdf` which will manually calculate the eCDF of the data. Test for bounds and monotonicity.
 

6. **10 points** - Implement the above function
    :::tip

    You may use any resources you find on the internet to implement this function, just cite your sources. You may also spot-check your work using Plotly's ecdf plot generator.

    :::


7. **10 points** Implement tests & a function `salaries_ecdf` that uses your previous functions to return salary ecdfs with undergraduate major as the first index level.

8. **10 points** Refactor your implementations to take a `GroupBy` object as input instead of a DataFrame.

9. **10 points** - Implement tests & for a function `gt_50_k` using `groupby.filter` to restrict your results to majors where the median salary is at least 50k. 

10. **10 points** - Using the functions we've built thus far, implement tests & a function `group_analysis` that takes any arbitrary numerical column and any arbitrary categorical column to display ecdf info by groupings.
