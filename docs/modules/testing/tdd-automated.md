The root of most programmers' frustrations is usually complexity. The raw power that programming affords us in handling complex logic efficiently means that mistakes in our code can be that much more costly as our code base, and if we never take the time to review our code and implement solutions that we find more elegant, even in retrospect, then we will often end up with a tangled mess that can send you on an eternal bug hunting adventure. That's no fun. 

The number one tool in a programmer's toolbelt to battle the complexity of the code they write is the automated test. 

Automated testing
- Designed to be run frequently and provide instant feedback on your code
- Integrated deeply into many business procedures/pipelines (DevOps)
- Essential – not optional – for clean code and good practices
- Just as much art as science
