### 1.1.1 - The Zen of Python

The Python community generally agrees on standards and changes to Python via the [Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) process. Early on in the development of Python, [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), referred to as the "Zen of Python", was written by Tim Peters and adopted by the community. Keeping these maxims in mind can go a long way towards writing clean, concise, and readable Python code. Here is the proposal in its entirety, with some of my favorites bolded for emphasis:

<pre>
Beautiful is better than ugly.
<br /><b>Explicit is better than implicit.</b>
<br />Simple is better than complex.
<br />Complex is better than complicated.
<br /><b>Flat is better than nested.</b>
<br />Sparse is better than dense.
<br />Readability counts.
<br />Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
<br />Although practicality beats purity.
<br />Errors should never pass silently.
<br />Unless explicitly silenced.
<br />In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
<br /><b>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</b>
<br />Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
<br />Now is better than never.
<br />Although never is often better than *right* now.
<br />If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
<br />If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
<br /><b>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</b>
</pre>
