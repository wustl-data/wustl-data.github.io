title: 1 - (re)Introduction to Python and Pandas
---

Our first module will go over some Python concepts that will be relevant to this course. Then we will go over Pandas and some of the basics behind its structure. Considering that most of you should have had some experience with both Python and Pandas already, this won't be a pure beginner's introduction, but a more nuanced look at some more specific features that should also provide a refresher on the basic concepts. If you are completely new to Python, but have experience in other languages, [Crash into Python](https://stephensugden.com/crash_into_python/) might be a helpful resource, but you should be able to follow along just fine.
