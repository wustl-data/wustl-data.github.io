For example, you might want to make sure that your data set does not contain any negative values for a variable that is supposed to be positive, like the number of people in a district. Alternatively, you might have some artificially imposed constraints that you might want to impose on your data set to make sure that it is internally consistent. For example, you might want to make sure that the values in a column labeled \\"State\\" are all valid US state abbreviations. Or, you might want to double check that a column labeled \\"Color\\" actually contains some kind of objective representation of color, like a hex code, an RGB value, or a color name.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"modules/cleaning/Background/dtypes":{"id":"modules/cleaning/Background/dtypes","title":"Data types of fields","description":"One of the first things we can do is make sure our data fields are represented with the correct data type.

It is a collection of Series objects, where each Series is a column of the DataFrame. Assuming good data organization, each column should represent a variable, and each row should represent an observation/record/data point. For example, if we have a collection of height and weight measurements, we could represent them as a DataFrame like:","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/pandas/index":{"id":"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/pandas/index","title":"Pandas","description":"Pandas, in essence, is a library built on top of NumPy that provides some user-friendly ways to organize and label data.

Python has classes as well, but we will use them sparingly in this course. Because \\"everything is an object\\" in Python, we can accomplish many of the same object-oriented principles in more concise ways. The mechanisms behind this philosophy are somewhat outside the scope of this course (link for the curious), but for now just keep in mind that it\'s often better to organize your code with modules (files) and functions rather than classes. That being said, you will frequently encounter classes in third-party packages (such as Pandas--more on this in a moment).","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/dict-comprehensions":{"id":"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/dict-comprehensions","title":"Dictionaries and Dict Comprehensions","description":"Dictionaries are a very powerful and common data structure in Python. Fundamentally, they are a set of key-value pairs. Usually (but not necessarily), keys are strings, while their corresponding values can be whatever you wish (including function handles). They are often an efficient way to handle branching circumstances in your code (as opposed to long if/elif statements).","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/imports-packages-modules":{"id":"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/imports-packages-modules","title":"Imports, Packages, and Modules","description":"At the top of most Python scripts you will see statements like:","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/list-comprehensions":{"id":"modules/python-pandas/Background and Exercises/Python/list-comprehensions","title":"List Comprehensions","description":"List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists.

Then we will go over Pandas and some of the basics behind its structure. Considering that most of you should have had some experience with both Python and Pandas already, this won\'t be a pure beginner\'s introduction, but a more nuanced look at some more specific features that should also provide a refresher on the basic concepts. If you are completely new to Python, but have experience in other languages, Crash into Python might be a helpful resource, but you should be able to follow along just fine.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"project/progress_report_1":{"id":"project/progress_report_1","title":"Progress Report 1","description":"Due: Oct 7th, 2022","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"project/specs":{"id":"project/specs","title":"Project Specification","description":"Project Goals","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"resources/dev-env/container-or-manual":{"id":"resources/dev-env/container-or-manual","title":"Dev Containers vs Manual Setup","description":"Which approach is right for you?","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"resources/dev-env/devcontainer":{"id":"resources/dev-env/devcontainer","title":"Dev Container Setup","description":"For now, the instructions in the assignment repository should get you going.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"resources/dev-env/manual":{"id":"resources/dev-env/manual","title":"Manual Environment Setup","description":"This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own local development environment as it applies to this class. It aims to cover common approaches and make suggestions to get you started -- you may use your own environment setups if you are more familiar with them (i.e. Anaconda distribution, pure-Windows setups, etc.). This should be a beneficial tutorial for those seeking to learn more about common software tools such as the command line and managing Python environments. However, those seeking a quicker and more convenient option should check out the Dev Container setup guide.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"resources/external":{"id":"resources/external","title":"External Resources","description":"This page of supplemental resources is made available for those who are interested in deeper information about a topic.
