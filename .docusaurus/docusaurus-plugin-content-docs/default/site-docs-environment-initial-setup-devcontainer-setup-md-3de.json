  "description": "Exciting developments in Docker containerization standards have brought Dev Containers to the VS Code IDE. This is a new feature that allows you to create a containerized development environment with a single click. This should provide a great way to standardize environment setup across students in the class with many different machines, operating systems, and levels/types of programming experience. However, you will likely need to customize your environment as you work on your assignments and projects.",
