  "description": "Exciting developments in Docker containerization standards have brought Dev Containers to the VS Code IDE. This is a new feature that allows for easy distribution of isolated and preconfigured development environment, fully equipped for VS Code with a single click. While new technologies can come with a bit of a learning curve, this setup should provide a more convenient way to standardize environment setup across students in the class with many different laptop models and programming backgrounds.",
