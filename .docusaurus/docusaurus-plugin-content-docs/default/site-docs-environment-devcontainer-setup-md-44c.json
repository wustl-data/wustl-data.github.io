  "description": "Exciting developments in container technology have brought [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers to VS Code. This is a new feature that allows you to create a containerized development environment with a single click. This should provide a great way to standardize environment setup across students in the class with many different machines, operating systems, and levels/types of programming experience However, you will likely want to customize your environment as you work on your projects. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own environment and I encourage everyone to perform the motions at least once. However, you are encouraged to use the Dev Container to speed up environment setup and focus on the course material.",
